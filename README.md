> __Note__ This is my first time ever using kotlin or making anything android related

## Vibrates an android watch (I have only tested on Galaxy watch 4) when high pitched noises are present

The main purpose is because I own [this](https://mysleepguard.com/) which emits a high pitched noise when grinding teeth.
This project intends to add additional stimuli rather than just the noise.

This could also be useful for hearing impaired people to notice noises they may otherwise not be able to.

TODO: Add a tracking system to see how many times it was used that night
